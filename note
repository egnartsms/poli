extra-syntactic items:
  - comment: pseudo syntax unit.
  - blank line: pseudo syntax unit.
  - split down after N first subunits: pseudo syntax unit, exact same as above. In future: autoformatting. Depends on the max column setting and the spec of the syntactic form.
  - extra indented syntax unit: property of the unit itself. In future: based on specification of the syntactic form itself (e.g. if), that is, autoformatting.
